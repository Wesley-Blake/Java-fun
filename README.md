# Learning Java by building Core Utils

## `cat` command
Simple and uses the io package instead of nio. I chose io becuase it is used for smalled applications and nio is more for larger files.


## `cd` command
I was working on this one, till I realized there isn't a way to change the working directory after the program has ended. If there is a way, I wasn't able to find it.
