# Learning Java by building Core Utils

## `cat` command
Simple and uses the io package instead of nio. I chose io becuase it is used for smalled applications and nio is more for larger files.

## `grep` command
Basic form of grep, can search for a word or list of words in a file.

## `head+tail` command
Prints the first 10 or last 10 lines of a plain text file.

## `ls` command
List each item in a directory line by line.

## `mkdir` command
Creates directories where you ask.

## `sort` command
Sort items provided as arguments.

## `spellChecker` command
Linux only, but uses the words file to check if words as arguments are spelled correctly.

# Apparenly not possible as far as I can see.

## `cd` command
I was working on this one, till I realized there isn't a way to change the working directory after the program has ended. If there is a way, I wasn't able to find it.
